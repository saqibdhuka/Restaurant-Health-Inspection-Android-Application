# CMPT 276 - Team Magnesium Term Project

## Project Information

As a team, we are expected to implement the features requested in the 'user stories' page.
The end result should be a useful Android app to view health inspection report data, and one that works well on various screen sizes.

## Iteration 1 Roles

### [Product Owner](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/scrum/roles/product-owner) - Minh

### [Scrum Master](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/scrum/roles/scrummaster) - Justin

### Repo Manager - Devon

### Team Member - Saqib

## Git Rules

We must use the complete Git workflow for this project! That means following the best practices we learned in class. In particular, NO pushing to master is allowed - follow the "branch/develop/merge request/merge" routine.

### Merging 

Each merge request should have a corresponding issue number assigned. 
Merge request titles should be of the form

	(FEATURE | BUGFIX): (Short description). <(my username)> <code reviewer username>

So, for example, a feature submitted by Pierre Jacques and reviewed by Jane Doe might be:

	FEATURE: Initial commit of restaurant listing activity. <pjacques> <jdoe>
	
Ensure the merge request body contains a link to the corresponding issue number. Merge requests may be marked WIP while you work on the branch.
	
### Code Reviews

All code must be peer-reviewed by at least one other person on the team before merging. Once major development on a branch is completed, rename the request from WIP to be in line with the above merge guidelines, and notify your peer. Something along the lines of

	@(username) please review
	
as a comment on the request should work.


Reviewers, look through the GitLab 'changed files' tab carefully. If any suggestions are  apparent, use the commenting tool to 'raise an issue' for the request submitter to resolve.

Remember, code reviews are not to look down upon team members - just to ensure we have multiple eyes on each line of code that comes in.

Once a reviewer is satisfied with the changes, comment a thumbs up emoji: üëç

After all reviewers have given the request the green light, reviewer should mention the repo manager to merge.

	@(repomanager) please merge.
	
	

All code must comply with Dr. Fraser's [Java Style Guide](https://opencoursehub.cs.sfu.ca/bfraser/grav-cms/cmpt276/course-info/styleguide).
